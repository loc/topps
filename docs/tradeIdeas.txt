Zack's ideas for how trades could work:

Two users involved in trade:

user one initiates a trade by sending an offer to user two - could send like a fb notification kind of message with the cards being offered as well as a list of the cards desired (everyone's collections are public)


user two can either accept user one's trade by sending back the cards they are willing to offer for the trade, or reject the trade outright

user one can confirm user two's trade counteroffer and the trade will go through. Otherwise, user one can reject the counteroffer and the trade dies

Done!

Also, we were talking about have some point system to be able to buy cards? Say users generate 1pt/sec online, and they can buy a card for 10 pts - something along those lines?
