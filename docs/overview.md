### Introduction

A community of users is both a dynamic and an interesting concept to model within an application. However, communities often require a common goal or interest in order to sustain themselves. This application models how a community interacts both with and through a set of collectible trading cards. In particular, our project models a plausible set of American Football trading cards which display information about various components of the sport, ranging from stats on individual players, to teams, to venues, to games played between teams. The structure of the National Football League (NFL) is also modeled in the background of the application so that relevant conference and division information can be included where it is needed on the trading cards. The cards display statistical and textual information, as well as images of the entity they are attempting to represent. 

These cards are collectible in the sense that not every user in the community owns a copy of each card in the set. Users are required to interact with each other in order to initiate trades and attain cards that they did not have previously. Thus, each user has a unique account (defined by a username and a password) which allows them to see the cards in their collection and take part in trades with other users. Users without an account cannot use the application, because a consistent online avatar is required to build a concrete community within the application.
